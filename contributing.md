Thank you for your interest in contributing to the React JS Quiz App! This document will guide you through the process of adding new quiz topics to our application.

## üìù How to Contribute a New Quiz Topic

### 1. Quiz Topic Structure

Each quiz topic in our application requires the following components:

  ```json
  {
      "id": "your-quiz-id",
      "title": "Your Quiz Title",
      "icon": "URL to your quiz icon"
  }
  ```

### 2. Required Files

To add a new quiz topic, you'll need to prepare:

1. **Quiz JSON File**
   - Create a new JSON file in `public/data/your-quiz-id.json`
   - Follow this structure for questions:

   ```json
   {
     "quizTitle": "Your Quiz Title",
     "questions": [
       {
         "question": "Your question text here?",
         "choices": [
           "Option 1",
           "Option 2",
           "Option 3",
           "Option 4"
         ],
         "correctAnswer": 0
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Minimum 10 questions required
   - Each question must have 4 choices
   - `correctAnswer` index should be 0-3 (corresponding to the correct choice)

2. **Icon Requirements**
   - SVG format preferred
   - Host on a reliable CDN (we recommend using jsdelivr.net)
   - Icon should be relevant to the quiz topic
   - Size: 48x48px recommended

### 3. Submission Process

1. **Fork the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/offensive-vk/reactjs-quiz-app.git

   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b quiz/your-quiz-name
   ```

3. **Add Your Files**
   - Place your quiz JSON file in `public/data/`
   - Update `src/components/Start.jsx` by adding your quiz type to the `quizTypes` array:

   ```jsx
   {
     id: 'your-quiz-id',
     title: 'Your Quiz Title',
     icon: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/your-cdn-path/icon.svg'
   }
   ```

4. **Test Your Changes**
